# Demand Forecasting
This project is used to learn about different time series forecasting techniques for store-item product forecasting using Kaggle Dataset.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective 
- Demand Forecasting is a field of predictive analytics used to predict customer demands to optimize supply decisions.
- How many products should the company have in stock? How often should they be restocked?
- Incorrect inventory management can lead to the following problems:
  - Customer wants to purchase a product, however not available. This leads to loss in potential profit and customer dissatisfaction.
  - Too many products are stocked and remain unsold. This is a problem for products with short shelf life.
- The task is to use historical sales records to estimate future demand.

### Methods Used
* Statistical Forecasting
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Streamlit, plotly
* scikit-learn
* scipy


## Challenges
- There are a lot of external factors that directly affect the number of purchases:
  - Seasonality
  - Weather
  - Events
  - Promotions
  - Weird customer behaviour

## Dataset
- Kaggle dataset
  - train.csv: Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015
  - test.csv: Need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for future.

## Visualizations
